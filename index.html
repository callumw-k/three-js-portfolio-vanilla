            <h3><a href="https://aidenkinder.com"></a>Journey Advenia</h3>
            <h4>Tech Stack:</h4>
            <p>React | Gatsby | Emotion | Stripe API & Checkout</p>

            <h4>Brief:</h4>
            <p>
              Aiden wanted a fast, minimalist website to sell his fiction novel,
              Journey Advenia. It needed to be able to process payments and
              notify Aiden of shipping details and customer purchases.
            </p>
            <h4>Overview & Rationale:</h4>
            <p>
              I settled on React and Gatsby as the front end frameworks. Gatsby
              meant the website would be exceptionally fast, as it statically
              generates the site at build time. Alongside this, using React
              allowed me to build out components quickly, using Emotion to
              create styled-components. Unfortunately, due to the release time
              frame getting moved forward, there wasn't time to build a custom
              checkout (which I planned initially). As a result, I integrated
              the website with Stripe Checkout. This means Aiden can modify
              product details through his Stripe dashboard, with the changes
              reflected through the website via API requests. Load times for
              aidenkinder.com hover around 200ms to 400ms (as measured by
              pingdom.com). These speeds allow for a great customer experience
              and make ordering Journey Advenia fast and simple.

            <h3>
              <a href="https://google.com"></a>Python ICO (Initial Coin
              Offering) Scalper
            </h3>
            <h4>Tech Stack:</h4>
            <p>Python | Nuitka | Gate.io & Kucoin API</p>
            <h4>Brief:</h4>
            <p>
              When new cryptocurrencies list on an exchange, the price generally
              increases in the initial 30-60 seconds after listing and then
              drops. I wanted to create a bot that would allow me to buy in as
              soon as possible after the token went live and sell once I had hit
              a certain profit. Hopefully, this would allow me to enter trades
              quicker than someone manually trading through the browser.
              Alongside this, the running profit percentage allowed me to best
              gauge when to take profits.
            </p>
            <h4>Overview & Rationale:</h4>
            <p>
              I chose Python to create the bot, as its easy syntax allowed me to
              get an MVP up and running quickly. It also had great SDKs for both
              Gate.io and Kucoin, which served as a wrapper for the API calls.
            </p>
            <p>I planned out the bot in fours stages:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Keep pinging the API to see if the order book is available for
                the new coin (when the order book goes live, it means you can
                trade the token).
              </li>
              <li>
                Continuously check my account balance to see if I was holding
                any of the token, and if not keep placing buy orders.
              </li>
              <li>
                Calculate a running profit/loss percentage from the current USD
                value compared to the initial USD value.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sell at either a pre-determined profit target or manually upon
                hitting the enter key.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3><a href="https://google.com"></a>This Website</h3>
            <h4>Tech Stack:</h4>
            <p>Good ol' HTML, CSS & Javascript | Vite | Three.js</p>
            <h4>Brief:</h4>
            <p>
              I needed to get something up fast as a portfolio piece for a job
              application. However, I still wanted the website to do something
              cool and demonstrate some front-end skillsets. I took inspiration
              from The Virtual Economy's website and created this, a
              space-themed interactive webpage. (I love space).
            </p>
            <h4>Overview & Rationale:</h4>
            <p>
              I considered spinning up a React, Next or Gatsby template for the
              project. However, I'd played around with Vite and noticed they had
              a "vanilla js" option. It'd be a while since I built anything out
              of pure HTML, CSS (well, SCSS, but still), and Javascript, so I
              thought I'd go back to my roots and use that as the "tech stack".
              In the end, three.js was going to be the primary focus, not a
              fancy framework. As far as websites go, this one isn't crazy. But
              it'll serve as a testing ground for cool three.js projects going
              forward. It doesn't take much to add to the website, and I'll
              likely keep it as a single page so I won't have to worry too much
              about components, i.e. navbar etc.
